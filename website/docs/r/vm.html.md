# skytap\_vm

Provides a Skytap Virtual Machine (VM) resource. The environment VM resource represents an image of a single virtual machine.

~> **NOTE:**
* VMs do not exist outside of environments or templates.
* An environment or template can have multiple VMs.
* Each VM is a unique resource. Therefore, a VM in a template will have a different ID than a VM in an environment created from that template.
* The VM will be run immediately after creation.

## Example Usage


```hcl
# Create a new vm
resource "skytap_vm" "vm" {
  template_id = 1473407
  vm_id = 37865463
  environment_id = "${skytap_environment.environment.id}"
  name = "my vm"
  cpus = 2
  ram = 4096

  os_disk_size = 40000

  disk  {
    name = "my disk"
    size = 4096
  }

  disk  {
      name = "my other disk"
      size = 4096
  }

  network_interface  {
     interface_type = "vmxnet3"
     network_id = "${skytap_network.network.id}"
     ip = "172.128.0.1"
     hostname = "myhost"

    published_service {
      name = "ssh"
      internal_port = 22
    }
  }
}

# Will work after VM resource is created
output "ssh_ip" {
  value = "${skytap_vm.vm.service_ips.ssh}"
}
output "ssh_port" {
  value = "${skytap_vm.vm.service_ports.ssh}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `environment_id` - (Required, Force New) ID of the environment you want to add the VM to. If updating with a new one then the VM will be recreated.
* `template_id` - (Required, Force New) ID of the template you want to create the vm from. If updating with a new one then the VM will be recreated.
* `vm_id` - (Required, Force New) ID of the VM you want to create the VM from. If updating with a new one then the VM will be recreated.
* `name` - (Optional, Computed) User-defined name. Limited to 100 characters. 
* `cpus` - (Optional, Computed) Number of CPUs allocated to this virtual machine. Valid range is 1 to 12. Maximum limit depends on the `max_cpus` setting.
* `ram` - (Optional, Computed) Amount of RAM allocated to this VM. Valid range is 256 and 131,072 (MB). Maximum limit depends on `max_ram` setting.
* `os_disk_size` - (Optional, Computed) The size of the OS disk. The disk size is in MiB; it will be converted to GiB in the Skytap UI. The maximum disk size is 2,096,128 MiB (1.999 TiB).
* `disk` - (Optional) Array of virtual disks within the VM. The disk size is in MiB; it will be converted to GiB in the Skytap UI. The maximum disk size is 2,096,128 MiB (1.999 TiB).

  * `name` - (Required) A unique name for the disk.
  * `size` - (Required) Specify the size of the disk. The new disk’s size should be provided in MiB. The minimum disk size is 2048 MiB; the maximum is 2096128 MiB (1.999 TiB).

  ~> **NOTE:** The name will be truncated to 33 UTF-8 characters after saving. If a name is not provided then the source VM's name will be used.

* `network_interface` - (Optional, Computed, ForceNew) A Skytap network adapter is a virtualized network interface card (also known as a network adapter). It is logically contained in a VM and attached to a network.
  * `interface_type` - (Required, Force New) Type of network that this network adapter is attached to.
  * `network_id` - (Required, Force New) ID of the network that this network adapter is attached to.
  *	`ip` - (Required, Force New) The IP address (for example, 10.1.0.37). Skytap will not assign the same IP address to multiple interfaces on the same network.
  * `hostname` - (Required, Force New) Limited to 32 characters. Valid characters are lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Cannot begin or end with hyphens. Cannot be `gw`.
  * `published_service` - (Optional, Force New) Generally, a published service represents a binding of a port on a network interface to an IP and port that is routable and accessible from the public Internet. This mechanism is used to selectively expose ports on the guest to the public Internet.

  ~> **NOTE:** Published services exist and are managed as aspects of network interfaces—that is, as part of the overall environment element.

    * `name` - (Required, Force New) A unique name for the published service.
    * `internal_port` - (Required, Force New) The port that is exposed on the interface. Typically this will be dictated by standard usage (e.g., port 80 for http traffic, port 22 for SSH).
* `user_data` - (Optional) VM user data, available from the metadata server and the skytap api
* `label` - (Optional) Set of labels for the instance. Structure is documented below.

The `label` block supports:

* `category` - (Required) Label category that  provide contextual meaning.
* `value` - (Required) Label value to be use for reporting

### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts) for certain operations:

* `create` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when launching the VM
* `update` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when stopping and starting the VM when necessary during update
* `delete` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when terminating the instance

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id`: The ID of the VM.
* `max_cpus`: Maximum settable CPUs for this VM.
* `max_ram`: RAM settable CPUs for this VM.
* `disk`: The disks.
   * `id`: The ID for the disk.
   * `type`: The type of disk.
   * `controller`: The disk controller.
   * `lun`: The logical unit number of the disk (LUN).
* `network_interface`: The network adapters.
  * `id`: The network adapter's ID.
* `published_service`: The published services.
  * `id`: The published service's ID.
  * `external_ip`: The published service's external IP.
  * `external_port`: Each published service's external port.

* `service_ips`: A map of external IP addresses. The key is the name of a published service - as defined in the `published_service` block.
* `service_ports`: A map of external ports. The key is the name of a published service - as defined in the `published_service` block.
